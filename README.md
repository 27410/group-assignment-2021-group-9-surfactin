# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 9 - Surfactin production in Bacillus subtilis

> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the
> requested information below and above ([Group Number] and [TITLE]) and remove this quoted part before submission (everything prepended with a >).
> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do â€“ up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days.
> Good luck!

Describe the overall aim of your project and what you have achieved. <- remove 
The aim of the project is to evalulate surfactin production in Bacillus subtillis. For this purpose 4 surfactin reactions have been added to an already known GSM of B. subtillis s. 168. After surfactin knock-in, different strategies for getting a higher yield have been tested. This includes changing carbon source, upregulation of genes that effect yield, and co-factor swap.
