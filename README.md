# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 9 - Surfactin production in Bacillus subtilis

## Project summary
The aim of this project is to evalulate surfactin production in *Bacillus subtillis*. For this purpose four surfactin reactions have been added to an already known GSM of *B. subtillis* s. 168. After surfactin knock-in, different strategies for getting a higher yield have been tested. This includes changing carbon source, upregulation of genes that effect yield found via FSEOF, and co-factor swap. 
Phenotypic phase plans have been used to evaulate the changes in carbon source and yield calculations have been made to follow the production of surfactin throughout changes made to the model. 
The surfactin yield at the end of the project was found as XXXXXX which is an improvement from XXXXX
