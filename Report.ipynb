    "#### Current and potential applications of Surfactin\n",
    "Surfactin is a versatile compound belonging to the surfactant group of molecules, which are characterized by their ability to lower the surface tension between a liquid and either another liquid, gas or solid.[1] This ability originates from the structural composition of surfactin, which contains both hydrophilic and lipophilic properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "Surfactin is naturally produced by species such as *Bacillus subtilis*, where it was first discovered. It was first isolated as a fibrin clotting inhibitor but has been proven to possess therapeutic properties and is most commonly used as an antibiotic. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Market potential of Surfactin\n",
    "he expected Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of surfactants is 4.5 % as forecasted in the period of 2020 to 2025, reaching an market size of 52.4 billion USD.[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Biosynthetic pathway of Surfactin\n",
    "The pathway of surfactin production is divided in to three main stages; precursor supplement, synthase transcription and export. "
